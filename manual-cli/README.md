# manual-cli

Minimal Fastify + TypeScript API server generated by `npm init @voder-ai/fastify-ts`.

## What you got

- Fastify HTTP server with a `GET /` "Hello World" endpoint
- TypeScript configuration for ES modules
- Minimal package.json with Fastify and TypeScript dependencies
- Basic npm scripts ready to be wired up in later stories

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile and run the server (these commands will be implemented in later stories):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser or HTTP client and call:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/
   ```

You should see a JSON response similar to:

```json
{"message": "Hello World from Fastify + TypeScript!"}
```
