# 001.0-DEVELOPER-TEMPLATE-INIT: Initialize Fastify TypeScript Template via npm init

## Release Goal

**Production-Ready Foundation** - Enable developers to get from zero to working API server in under 30 seconds with a single npm init command.

This story establishes the foundational template initialization mechanism that serves as the entry point for all subsequent developer workflows. It connects to the "Initialize Project" journey phase where developers scaffold new API projects.

## How This Story Contributes

This story is the critical first step in the developer journey - without the ability to initialize a project, no other template functionality can be accessed. It enables:

- **Immediate value delivery**: Developer runs one command and has a working project structure
- **Foundation for all other stories**: Stories 002.0+ build upon this initialized structure
- **Distribution mechanism**: Establishes how the template reaches developers (npm init pattern)
- **First impression**: Sets expectations for developer experience and ease of use

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can start building API features immediately without spending hours on boilerplate setup, as an API Developer, I want to initialize a new Fastify TypeScript project with one npm command.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: No dependencies - this is the starting point for all template functionality
- **Negotiable**: Template structure and npm init configuration can be refined based on developer feedback
- **Valuable**: Delivers immediate concrete value - a working project developers can run and extend
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - npm init template package with minimal viable project structure
- **Small**: Can be completed in a single iteration - focused on initialization only, not full feature set
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria - can initialize, has expected files, package.json is valid

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Template Initialization Works**: Running `npm init @voder-ai/fastify-ts my-api` creates a new directory with template files
- [ ] **Minimal Project Structure**: Initialized project includes package.json, tsconfig.json, basic index.ts with Fastify "Hello World" server, and README
- [ ] **Valid Package Configuration**: Generated package.json has correct name, type: "module", basic dependencies (fastify, typescript), and placeholder npm scripts
- [ ] **TypeScript Setup**: Basic tsconfig.json with ES modules configuration is included
- [ ] **Documentation Present**: README explains what the template provides and points to next steps
- [ ] **Clean Initialization**: No errors during npm init process, no leftover template artifacts in initialized project
- [ ] **Project Independence**: Initialized project is a standalone Git repository, not linked to template repository

## Requirements

- **REQ-INIT-NPM-TEMPLATE**: Template must be publishable as npm init template (package name format `create-*` or `@scope/*`)
- **REQ-INIT-DIRECTORY**: Template creates new directory with project name provided by developer
- **REQ-INIT-FILES-MINIMAL**: Template includes only essential files: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts, README.md, .gitignore
- **REQ-INIT-FASTIFY-HELLO**: src/index.ts contains minimal Fastify server that responds to GET / with "Hello World" or similar
- **REQ-INIT-ESMODULES**: Template configured for ES modules (package.json "type": "module", tsconfig.json moduleResolution)
- **REQ-INIT-TYPESCRIPT**: TypeScript is included as dependency with basic configuration
- **REQ-INIT-NO-SCRIPTS-YET**: Package.json includes placeholder scripts (dev, build, start) with comments indicating they're added in later stories
- **REQ-INIT-README-NEXT-STEPS**: README includes "Next Steps" section referencing `npm install` (story 002.0)
- **REQ-INIT-GIT-CLEAN**: Template does not include .git directory or template-specific metadata in initialized project
- **REQ-INIT-OFFLINE-CAPABLE**: Template initialization works without internet (after template package is installed/cached)

## Dependencies

None - This is story 001.0, the foundational starting point with no dependencies.

## Implementation Notes

Template will be distributed as `@voder-ai/fastify-ts` via npm init:

```bash
npm init @voder-ai/fastify-ts my-api
```

**Context for Developers**:

- This is a minimal bootstrap - just enough to create a valid project structure
- Placeholder npm scripts should indicate which stories add working implementations
- README should guide developers to next step (002.0-DEVELOPER-DEPENDENCIES-INSTALL)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] npm init template package is published (or ready to publish)
- [ ] Running `npm init @voder-ai/fastify-ts my-api` creates working project directory
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully in fresh environment
- [ ] Template initialization documented in template repository README
- [ ] Story map updated with story reference
- [ ] Ready for story 002.0 (dependency installation)
