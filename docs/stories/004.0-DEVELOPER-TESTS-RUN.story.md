# 004.0-DEVELOPER-TESTS-RUN: Run All Tests Successfully

## Release Goal

**Production-Ready Foundation** - Enable developers to get from zero to working API server in under 30 seconds with a single npm init command.

This story completes a critical part of the "Verify Setup" journey phase by ensuring all tests run successfully and developers understand the testing framework. After dependencies are installed (002.0), developers need to verify that the test suite works correctly and understand how to use tests during development.

## How This Story Contributes

This story builds confidence that the template is production-ready and provides developers with the knowledge to maintain quality as they build. It enables:

- **Quality Assurance**: All template tests pass, confirming the codebase is working correctly
- **Testing Knowledge**: Developer understands how to run tests, watch for changes, and check coverage
- **Development Workflow**: Developer knows how to add tests for new features (enables 009.0 route examples with tests)
- **CI/CD Confidence**: Passing tests locally means CI/CD pipeline will pass, reducing friction in deployment

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can verify the template works correctly and understand how to write tests for my features, as an API Developer, I want all existing tests to pass and to know how to run tests during development.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Depends only on 002.0 (dependencies installed); can be developed in parallel with 003.0, 006.0, 007.0
- **Negotiable**: Specific test commands and coverage thresholds can be refined based on project needs
- **Valuable**: Enables confident development - developer can verify changes don't break existing functionality
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - run tests, verify they pass, understand test watch mode and coverage reporting
- **Small**: Single iteration - focused on running and understanding existing tests
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria - `npm test` passes, coverage reports generated, watch mode works

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **All Tests Pass**: Running `npm test` executes all tests and they pass with green output
- [x] **Fast Test Execution**: Complete test suite runs in under 5 seconds
- [x] **Test Coverage Report**: Running tests shows coverage percentage for lines, statements, branches, and functions
- [x] **Watch Mode Available**: Developer can run tests in watch mode that re-runs tests when files change
- [x] **Clear Test Output**: Test results show which tests passed, with clear error messages for any failures
- [x] **TypeScript Test Support**: Tests written in TypeScript execute without additional compilation step
- [x] **Multiple Test File Formats**: Template includes tests demonstrating different patterns (.test.ts, .test.js, .test.d.ts)
- [x] **Fast Feedback Loop**: Watch mode detects changes and re-runs affected tests in under 2 seconds
- [x] **Coverage Thresholds**: Template includes reasonable coverage thresholds (e.g., 80% lines) that can be adjusted

## Requirements

- **REQ-TEST-ALL-PASS**: All tests in initialized template pass on first run with zero failures
- **REQ-TEST-FAST-EXEC**: Complete test suite executes in under 5 seconds on typical development machine
- **REQ-TEST-WATCH-MODE**: Test watch mode available via `npm test -- --watch` or similar command
- **REQ-TEST-COVERAGE**: Coverage report generated showing line, statement, branch, and function coverage
- **REQ-TEST-TYPESCRIPT**: TypeScript tests execute directly without manual compilation step
- **REQ-TEST-CLEAR-OUTPUT**: Test output clearly indicates pass/fail status with readable formatting
- **REQ-TEST-EXAMPLES**: Template includes test examples for server routes, utility functions, and type definitions
- **REQ-TEST-VITEST-CONFIG**: Vitest configuration supports both ESM and CommonJS test patterns

## Dependencies

- **002.0-DEVELOPER-DEPENDENCIES-INSTALL**: Test framework and dependencies must be installed before tests can run

## Implementation Notes

**Developer Context**:

- This story focuses on verification AND education - developer should understand how testing works in the template
- The template uses Vitest as the testing framework (per ADR 0004-vitest-testing-framework)
- Developer should see examples of different test patterns (unit tests, integration tests, server tests)
- After this story completes, developer understands how to add tests for their custom routes (needed for 009.0)

**Testing Framework Context**:

- Vitest provides fast test execution with native ESM and TypeScript support
- Watch mode enables rapid feedback during development
- Coverage reports help developers understand what code is tested
- Multiple test file formats demonstrate flexibility for different scenarios

**Integration Points**:

- Enables 009.0-DEVELOPER-ROUTE-EXAMPLE (developer needs to understand testing to write route tests)
- Supports CI/CD pipeline quality gates (tests must pass before deployment)
- Complements 007.0-DEVELOPER-LINT-FORMAT (tests ensure code works, linting ensures code style)

## Definition of Done

- [x] npm test runs successfully in initialized project
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Test watch mode works and provides fast feedback
- [x] Coverage report displays with clear metrics
- [x] Test examples demonstrate common patterns
- [x] Documentation explains test commands and workflow
- [x] Story map updated with story reference
- [x] Ready for story 009.0 (route examples need test knowledge)
